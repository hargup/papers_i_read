Two sentence Summary
====================
This paper analyzes Wikipedia content for Coverage, Structural, Lexical and Visibility
biases with respect to gender gap.

Outline of the Main Points (assumptions, arguments, data and conclusions)
=========================================================================
Assumptions:

* Analysis of the gender bias of biography articles is a good indication of
  overall gender bias of Wikipedia.

Data:
* Data for Wikipedia was collected using Wikidata.
* The paper used Freebase, MIT Media Lab's Pantheon and Human Accomplishment
  data to compare their Coverage bias with that of Wikipedia. The paper didn't
analyze these datasets for Structural and Lexical Bias.


Findings and Conclusions:

* Biographies of women were slightly longer than that of men on Wikipedia also
  both the biographies of men and women have pretty much equal chances of
getting featured on the main page. This indicates that the editor community of
Wikipedia is aware of it gender gap and works consciously to reduce it.

* Biographies of men are written very differently from the biographies of
  women, biographies of women are more likely to be linked with biographies of
men than vice versa. Biographies of men are more likely to be in centre of
networks of Wikipedia biographies. Also biographies of women were often
characterized by then being biographies of women rather than by their
individual achievements/stories.





Limitations or Extensions
=========================

* An obvious extension will be observing how the editor demographics correlate
  with the degree of these biases. Do writings of male editors have more bias
or do writing of female editors have more bias etc.

* Measure how do these numbers change over the years and if Wikipedia is
  becoming more or less biased.

* The papers can be extended to do lexical analysis on non biography articles
  to find where male has been assumed to the null gender, for example on the
article on capitalism, caption on a photograph of worker was "A female
industrial worker".

* [As Max mentioned in his
  review](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Newsletter/2015/May#Notable_women_.22slightly_overrepresented.22_.28not_underrepresented.29_on_Wikipedia.2C_but_the_Smurfette_principle_still_holds)
of the paper, this paper was very Eurocentric as all the languages used in the
analysis were European. An extension 

* The paper ignored non binary genders.

Opinion: Quality and potential Impact
=====================================

Overall I found the paper to be of pretty good quality, it relied on a more
in-depth and computational analysis of the content of paper than just the
number of male biographies vs number of female biographies.
